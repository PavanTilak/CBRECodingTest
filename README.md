These designs are provided to candidates. Here's a gif of the app running: Restaurant Android Demo Instructions Instructions

Overview :
The goal of this coding challenge is to construct a basic Android application that highlights your knowledge of best practices within the Android ecosystem, Kotlin, and overall software design. Show us code your cleanest, production-ready code.
Requirements Requirements
Used Kotlin 100%, so you should too. Use RxJava for network calls. Follow the included designs as closely as you can. It is not necessary to add extra enhancements or features. It is not necessary to include tests, but your code should be clean and easy to test. Will be tested in phones of different sizes so please consider that when making the screens.

Additional Information:
The API host is: http://dallas-restaurants.33gfuuywva.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com The restaurants endpoint is: /restaurants Designs and all necessary image assets are included
